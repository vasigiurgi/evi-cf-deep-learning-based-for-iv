KITTI Road, KITTI Semantic, Road Detection, Semantic Segmentation, Evidence Theory

# Overview 
In this work, evidence theory is combined with a camera-lidar-based deep learning fusion architecture. The coupling is based on generating basic belief functions using distance to prototypes. It also uses a distance-based decision rule
